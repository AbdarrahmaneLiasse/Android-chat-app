  ## üë®‚Äçüîß Architecture
This app uses [***MVVM (Model View View-Model)***](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture.

1) The UI components are kept away from the business logic

2) The business logic is kept away from the database operations

3) It's easy to read (because everything has specific places to live)

4) And if done correctly, you have a lot less to worry about when it comes to lifecycle events (ex: screen rotations)
